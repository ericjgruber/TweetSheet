# TweetSheet
Playing around with the Twitter API to pull in a timeline and display on a single page.

This needs to live on a web server that runs PHP. I have it live on my local
web development environment, and then bookmark the URL. For example, it might
look something like http://my.local/TweetSheet. It can be whatever you set it up
as, of course.

1. Clone this directory.
2. Visit https://dev.twitter.com/apps/ and create an app called TweetSheet.
Really, it can be called whatever you want; this is simply to get the needed
access tokens so this page will work.
3. Make note of the access tokens. In the settings array in index.php, put your
access tokens in the correct place.
4. Fire up the URL on the webserver of your choice, and read your feed.

Note: This was mostly for my own personal experimentation, but feel free to
contact me if you have questions or just want to chat.
